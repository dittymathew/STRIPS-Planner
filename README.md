# STRIPS-Planner
STRIPS ( Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver ) is an automatic planner developed by Richard Fikes and Nils Nilsson in 1971 .

A STRIPS model consists of:
an initial state;
a target state, i.e. the situation that the planner wants to achieve;
a lot of actions. For each action there must be:
Preconditions (what must be present before the action can be performed);
Postconditions (what is achieved after the action has been performed).

Here we set up a framework to experiments with generalization of STRIPS.
